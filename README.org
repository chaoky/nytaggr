#+title: Readme

Hi,
since I didn't had a lot of free time this week I decided aganist using Sangria,
which was one of the library constraints, and using Caliban instead,
since Caliban comes with http4s support there was no need to make a custom wrapper [[https://github.com/tpolecat/doobie-http4s-sangria-graphql-example][like this one]]

there are two ways of getting articles from [[https://www.nytimes.com/][The New York Times]],
simply using their http rest API or crawling their web page,
the scraping happens in a background job every hour (I don't know how often their front page chages)

* [[./instructions.md][instructions]]
* Development
** setup postgres
#+begin_src bash
docker compose up
#+end_src
** devlop with sbt-revolver
#+begin_src bash
sbt ~reStart
#+end_src
** test
#+begin_src bash
sbt test
#+end_src

* Deploy
** with docker and the github registry
#+begin_src bash
docker compose -f deploy-compose.yml up -d
#+end_src
