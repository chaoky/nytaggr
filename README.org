#+title: The New York Times Link Aggregator

Hi,
since I didn't had a lot of free time this week I decided against using Sangria,
which was one of the library constraints, and using Caliban instead,
since Caliban comes with http4s support there was no need to make a custom wrapper [[https://github.com/tpolecat/doobie-http4s-sangria-graphql-example][like this one]],
I may add a Sangria implementation soon

there are two ways of getting articles from [[https://www.nytimes.com/][The New York Times]],
simply using their http rest API or crawling their web page,
since I don't know how often their front page changes,
the scraping happens in a background job every hour

there's still a lot left to do in this project,
the tests are pretty poor and the error handling is not [[https://guillaumebogard.dev/posts/functional-error-handling/][ideal]],
I'm sure there's some inter-op between Cats MTL and ZIO's error channel,
but I didn't had a lot of time to look into it

[[https://www.prisma.io/migrate][Prisma]] is what I usually use for sql migrations
but since I didn't want to include node_modules in this project
this setup query has to be ran once
~on Emacs, just =C-c C-c= the code block below to run it with babel~

#+begin_src sql-mode
CREATE TABLE headline (link VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY, title VARCHAR NOT NULL);
#+end_src
